## List of Projects Where New Maintainer is Needed
These projects are an inevitable part of the Efuzy framework, but to keep on our promise "to raise the bar for web development as a whole" we are looking for an active maintainer.

If you are interested, read [The Role of the Project Maintainer](/contribution-guide/project-maintainer) and let Razvan know via [Discord chat](https://chat.efuzy.dev/).
