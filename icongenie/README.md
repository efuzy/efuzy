## What is Icon Genie

You love the default Efuzy logo, probably as much as the team does, but you just spent what feels like a lifetime making your own pixel-perfect representation of the soul of your application and now you want to replace that logo with your own!

There are many different situations where your icon might be seen: in the browser tab, on the desktop, on the home screen of a mobile phone and even in an app store. Then there are splashscreens to create in all the various device sizes and orientations.

This means you need your logo in about 100+ different sizes with representative names, arcane formats, placed in the correct folders and probably some proper `<xml>` declarations for Cordova too. Even if you know exactly what you’re doing, this is a tedious and error-prone task. To make your life easy and care-free, we’ve built the Icon Genie CLI tool to make this exhausting process dead simple.

## Installation of Icon Genie

$ yarn global add @efuzy/icongenie
