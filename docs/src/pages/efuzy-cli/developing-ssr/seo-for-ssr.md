The term SEO refers to Search Engine Optimization. And Efuzy covers this aspect too through the [Efuzy Meta Plugin](/efuzy-plugins/meta).

## Efuzy Meta Plugin

The [Efuzy Meta Plugin](/efuzy-plugins/meta) can dynamically change page title, manage `<meta>` tags, manage `<html>` and `<body>` DOM element attributes, add/remove/change `<style>` and `<script>` tags in the head of your document (useful for CDN stylesheets or for json-ld markup, for example), or manage `<noscript>` tags.

::: tip
This Efuzy plugin has the most tight integration with Efuzy and so it has the best performance against any other similar solution.
